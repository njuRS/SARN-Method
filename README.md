<h1 align="center">River Connection Code</h1>

# Environment
Python with ``ArcPy`` package
# Data preparation
- ``DEM-modeled drainage network.shp``:the DEM-modeled drainage network polyline
- ``RS-mapped river network.shp``:the river centerlines of the RS water body mask 
- ``RS water mask.tif``:the binary water body mask, water is set to 1, non-water is 0
## Install tools
``2DSpecTools`` and ``OBNLMpackage tools`` have been offered on the GitHub.

Download ``DIPimage`` from http://www.diplib.org/download and install it.

## Set Path
- Click **set path** in Matlab GUI. 
- Add ``2DSpecTools``, ``OBNLMpackage``, ``DIPimage tools``, ``Matlab River Detection code`` folder to **MATLAB environment**. 
- **Save**.

## Open ``Matlab River Detection code`` folder in MATLAB
![alt text](https://github.com/njuRS/picture/blob/master/1549183850(1).jpg?raw=true)

## Change the path of ``DIPimage`` in ``pathopening.m``

# Run river detection code
Here, we provide ``run_river_detection.m`` to detect river in single image and ``run_batch_river_detection.m`` for batch detection. 

- Open ``Matlab River Detection code`` folder in MATLAB. 
![alt text](https://github.com/njuRS/picture/blob/master/1549183850(1).jpg?raw=true)
- Open ``run_river_detection.m`` or ``run_batch_river_detection.m``. 
- Write the **image path**. ``test_sentinel2_image.tif`` is provided as test image. 
- Set input **6 parameters**. 

| parameters | description |
|----|---|
|  |  **WV**: WorldView image  |
|  |  **SPOT**: SPOT image  |
|*sensor*  |  **Sentinel2**: Sentinle-2 image after NDWI calculation  |
|  |  **Landsat**: Landsat panchromatic image  |
|  |  **LandsatNDWILandsat**: image after NDWI calculation  |
|*inverse*  |set 1 to convert dark rivers into bright rivers (e.g., for panchromatic image); set 0 to keep bright rivers (e.g., for NDWI images)|
|*width*  |small river width for Gabor filter, default = 2|
|*ppo_length*  |path opening length, default = 20|
|*histCountThreshold*  |a pixel count threshold to stretch image pixel values, default = 1000|
|*Smooth (optional)*  |used for denoise algorithm. Because denoise algorithm is too slow and scale dependent, is abandoned for large images,  default = 0.7|

**You can add your customized sensor (image) easily. The only requirement is to reset the band pass frequency based on the spatial resolution of your input image.**

- Click **run**.

If you see these commands in the command window, the river detection code is running successfully.

You will get 3 processed images. ``test_sentinel2_image_bandpass_gabor_cpo20.tif`` is the final result.
